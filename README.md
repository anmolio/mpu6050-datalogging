# mpu6050-datalogging
This code helps you to log data of MPU 6050 into an sd card, the code used for MPU 6050 is the one which is already available in github written by Jeff Rowberg, just data logging with timing is added in this set.

The connections with Arduino Uno, is in the images the connections for MPU6050 and SD Card are shown in two different images, but you have to combined into only one UNO board.

The MPU 6050 works on I2C protocol and SD card via SPI. Both of these protocol are activated and used simultanious in this code.
